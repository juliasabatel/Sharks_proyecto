#  Sharks_proyecto

First project carried out on database cleaning. Specifically, it consists of obtaining a main objective, which is to know which country has the highest number of people killed by shark attacks. 
In order to reach this objective, the first step was to clean the selected columns through which more information was extracted, such as the type of death or sex.

# Goals

🧹Clean the dataset 

✂️ Maintain at least 6000 rows 

⚙️ Use of five cleaning techniques

🌍 Know which are the countries with more shark deaths

⛵️ Deaths from shark attacks by type

✨ Shark attack fatalities by gender
